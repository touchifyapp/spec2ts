# Contributing to spec2ts 

> Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
> By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. 

First, ensure you have the [latest `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/). 

To get started with the repo: 

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:touchifyapp/spec2ts.git && cd spec2ts 
$ npm ci 

$ npx lerna bootstrap 
# or, if lerna is globally installed 
$ lerna bootstrap 
```

## Code Structure 

Currently, the [source](https://github.com/touchifyapp/spec2ts/tree/master) is a [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepo containing the following components, located in the `packages` directory: 
- `core`: Helpers methods to generate TypeScript code. 
- `jsonschema`: Utility to generate types from JSON schemas. [More details](https://github.com/touchifyapp/spec2ts/blob/master/packages/jsonschema/README.md). 
- `openapi`: Utility to generate types from Open API v3 specifications. [More details](https://github.com/touchifyapp/spec2ts/blob/master/packages/openapi/README.md). 
- `openapi-client`: Utility to generate HTTP Client from Open API v3 specifications. [More details](https://github.com/touchifyapp/spec2ts/blob/master/packages/openapi-client/README.md). 
- `cli`: CLI wrapper to generate types from Open API v3 specifications and JSON schemas. [More details](https://github.com/touchifyapp/spec2ts/blob/master/packages/cli/README.md). 

## Commands 

Commands are handled by npm scripts, and can be executed: 
- from a package directory using `npm run <cmd>` (acts on one package) 
- from the root directory using `npm run <cmd>` (acts on all packages) 
- from the root directory using `lerna run <cmd>` (acts on each packages containing this `cmd`) 

### Build 

```sh
$ npm run build 
# or 
$ lerna run build 
```

### Unit Tests 

```sh
# Run all test suites 
$ npm run test 
# or 
$ lerna run test 

# Run a specific suite from a file (e.g. packages/openapi/tests/openapi-parser.spec.ts from root directory) 
$ npm run test packages/openapi/tests/openapi-parser.spec.ts 

# Use pattern matching 
$ npm run test openapi-parser 

# Skip cleanup and linting 
$ npm run test:jest 
# etc 
```

### Coverage 

If you would like to check test coverage, run the coverage command then open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your favorite browser. 

```sh
# Generate coverage reports 
$ npm test:coverage 

# Open reports with OS X 
$ open coverage/lcov-report/index.html 

# Open reports with Linux 
$ xdg-open coverage/lcov-report/index.html 
```

### Lint 

```sh
$ npm run lint 
```

It's also a good idea to hook up your editor to an eslint plugin. 

To fix lint errors from the command line: 

```sh
$ npm run lint:fix
```

### Local CLI Testing 

Lerna handles dependencies between packages through symlinks so local packages are kept up to date regarding one another. 
To test out a development build of spec2ts or any other subcommand, simply execute the spec2ts cli using `node`. 

Exemple for @spec2ts/openapi specifying output location with `-o <output>` option: 
```sh
$ lerna run build
$ cd packages/cli
$ node ./bin/spec2ts.js openapi ../openapi/tests/assets/petstore.yml -o .

# without build using ts-node, prefix with npx or install globally
$ ts-node ./bin/spec2ts.ts openapi ../openapi/tests/assets/petstore.yml -o .
```
